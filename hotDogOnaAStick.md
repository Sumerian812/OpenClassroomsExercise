# Hot Dog on a Stick
>Hot Dog on a Stick, is a fast food company that was founded by Dave Barham in Santa Monica, California,[1] in 1946,[2] and later branched out into malls and shopping centers. In 2014, the company was purchased by Global Franchise Group (the strategic brand management company behind Great American Cookies, Marble Slab Creamery, and Pretzelmaker.) based in Atlanta, GA. Under GFG, the brand has opened new locations across the country and moved into the franchising space.

I went to their original Muscle Beach location next to the Santa Monica Pier in Santa Monica, California. They are well known for their lemonades, which was actually one their first product to sell besides the hot dog.
**Truly one of the best lemonades I've ever had!**
