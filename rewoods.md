Last summer I went to the Yosemite National Park. 

>Yosemite National Park (/joʊˈsɛmɪti/ yoh-SEM-i-tee[4]) is a United States national park lying in the western Sierra Nevada[5] of California.[6] The park, which is managed by the U.S. National Park Service, covers an area of 747,956 acres (1,168.681 sq mi; 302,687 ha; 3,026.87 km2).[2] Designated a World Heritage Site in 1984, Yosemite is internationally recognized for its granite cliffs, waterfalls, clear streams, giant sequoia groves, lakes, mountains, meadows, glaciers, and biological diversity.[7] Almost 95% of the park is designated wilderness.

I got to see some of the largest trees in the world. A lot of happy and quite chubby chipmunks live there too :)
